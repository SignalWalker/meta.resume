# Ash Walker's Resume

My resume is stored in [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/) format. This repository keeps track of that and uses GitHub actions to render it to HTML when changed.

The rendered output can be viewed at [signalwalker.github.io/meta.resume](https://signalwalker.github.io/meta.resume).
